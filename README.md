# wuzzuf.net data exploration
  
The project details are mentioned in ./WuzzufDataExploration_TaskDescription.pdf .  
Also the exploration report in ./WuzzufDataExploration_report.pdf .  
the data can be download from this [link](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0BwTer3zGrfsyYk5QNThYTmY3OUU/view).   
Project tree :
- ./graphs/ : this folder contains all the graphs used in the project, and they are all generated using plot.ly.
- ./*.ipynb : files with the cleaning/exploration stages code.
-  ./data/fixed/ : contains two files, the json file (mentioned in the report) and the main data-set.  
- ./data/generated/ : contains all the files generated by the code ( you need to run the ipynb first to generate them).

Notes :
- please download the data set and save it to the path ./data/fixed/
- Also you need to run the file "cleaning_data.ipynb" before the file "groupingby_date_city.ipynb" due to dependency.
